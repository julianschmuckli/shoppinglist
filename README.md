This is a service, where you can create shopping lists.

With the shoppinglist, you can add products to a list and share them across multiple devices. Also to add quickly products, which has been gone out, you can simply scan the product with a barcode scanner and add them to a list. If it has not recognised the product, you can add the product to a private product list or make it public available.
